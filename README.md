# React Quiz Application centered on trivia / countries of the world

- Quiz App using 2 different APIs, trivia api and RESTcountries API 
- This App uses Tailwind CSS for layout and styling

# things to do: 

- add reset button (with alert to confirm)
- add button to play again or go back to main menu when quiz ends
- add dropdown / form to choose question types, difficulty, categories, length, etc (check from API all options)
- Add more info from the API such as what category each question is, or difficulty (maybe?)
- Once all this is done, do an awesome styling to all the application

- Mimic all this with countries app and see to add new features (interactive map maybe)
